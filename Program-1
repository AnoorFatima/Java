// import java.io.*;   -- import all the classes of the java.io package, which deals with input and output operations.

class Program {                          // class- keyword used to define a class named Program or blueprint for creating objects.
    public void Display(){               // public- access specifier, void- return type (no return type or empty), Display- method name
        System.out.println("Hello");  // system- our computer system (.) access method- output, println- prints with line break

class Main_P{   //main class and first executable statement from where the complier starts execution (only compulsory part in java prog)
    public static void main(String args[]){        // static method- they get their memory before their class is instantiated
        Program obj = new Program();              // syntax: ClassName objectName = new ClassName(); - creating object of class Program

 /* Access specifiers- (to implement encapsulation and abstraction in OOP)
 1. public - accessible from anywhere
 2. private - accessible only within the same class
 3. protected - accessible within the same package and subclasses in other packages. Can only be used by child or inherited classes
 4. default (no specifier) - accessible only within the same package 

 Access specifiers - decides the scope (within the class, function, program and file)
 Member variables - variables declared inside a class but outside any method (instance variables)
 Member functions - functions declared inside a class 

 Java is a statically typed language (type for variable is defined at compile time)
 
 public static void main(String args[]){   -  static method- they get their memory before their class is instantiated
  public - access specifier, static- memory allocation, void- return type (no return type or empty), main- method name
  if not static- compiler won't read the program
  we always use 'public' keyword
  String args[] - Java only reads a string any value passed will be converted to a string. So any value given will be treated
  or read as a string by java compiler

Execution of this program: will start from line 10 (main method), then line 11 (creating object of class Program), then 
line 3, line 4 (public void display function)

Bimding- linking function calling with function definition
After reading System.out.println("Hello"); , it will check the import statement.
