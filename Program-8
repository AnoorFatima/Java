OOPS:-
Inheritance- Single/ Multi-level/ Hybrid/ Hierarchical Python
In Java, we have Single level inheritance and multi-level inheritance only, to
implement multiple inheritance, we cannot directly implement this using classes
but it is possible with the help of class and interfaces.

1. Single- In single level inheritance, we have a base class/ parent class or super class
and derived class/ child class or sub class.

2. Multi Level- In multi level inheritance we cn further extend the derived class as
the base class for next derived class until we finalize or consider a class as final.

class A
class B
class C

Example and Syntax:
class Parent/Super/Base
{
member variables(data)
member functions (attributes)
}
class child/sub/base extend Parent
{
member variables (data)
member functions (attributes)
}
class Main
{
main()
}
obj child

Write a program to create automatic response system 
1. to design this we have a base class with all the required details for a system to
respond on a query.
(a. Course Suggestion for a student looking for a suitable course after 12 suggestion
based on Humanities/Medical/Non Medical/Commerce
b. suggest course according to the budget
c. suggest course according to the duration
d. suggest course according to the location/online/offline/hybrid)
2. design a classes to for accepting user queries and handle response
3. design a main class that have main method and display Menu to display options and
services available in our automatic response system.
