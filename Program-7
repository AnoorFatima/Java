/* Constructor in Java:
1. Special type of method with name same as class name.
2. Always declared as public
3. No retuen type not even void
4. Use to initialize member variables
5. No need to call, automatically get called when we create instance (object of the class)
6. Types of constructor:
default constructor/constructor with default value/parametrized constructor 
constructor overloading
7. In inheritance, the hierarchy of constructor is first base class constructor will get invoked
and then child class constructor even though we always create child class object in inheritance.
